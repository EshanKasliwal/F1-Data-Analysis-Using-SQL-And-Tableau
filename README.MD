Explore the exciting world of Formula 1 through this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project conducted using SQL. The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of Formula 1 races, circuits, drivers, and constructors, allowing us to uncover insightful patterns and statistics. 

The project encompasses a variety of SQL queries, each designed to extract valuable information and generate meaningful visualizations. As you navigate through the analysis, you'll gain a deeper understanding of Formula 1's historical and competitive landscape.
